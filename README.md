# userstyles - some drafts of user styles

These are some drafts of user styles. They can be used with a user-style
manager such as [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html). They may still have
bugs. As of this writing, I haven&rsquo;t uploaded them to a user styles
repository such as [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/).

## License

This repository is licensed under [0BSD](https://spdx.org/licenses/0BSD.html).
See [**`LICENSE`**](LICENSE).

This is a [very
permissive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain-equivalent_license)
license, which does not even require that you retain the copyright notices.
Usually there is no benefit to removing them, even when permitted, but in the
case of stylesheets, you might prefer not to have the added cruft. If for
whatever reason you don&rsquo;t want those comments at the top of the style
sheets, feel free to remove them (as the license itself already permits). For
your convenience in doing so, there is a `no-license-comments` branch where
they are removed. **This is that branch.** (Note that they have no effect on
what is rendered&mdash;they do not appear in pages or anything, they&rsquo;re
just inert comments at the top of the CSS code itself.)

By the way, as is usually the case with user styles, **I&rsquo;m *not*
affiliated with any of the sites these user styles are for**.

## History

Versions of some of these were originally posted as gists. They are probably
still similar to those gists, but I recommend you use this repository instead
even for them, because:

- Updates/bugfixes, if any, will go here.
- New user styles go here (and it&rsquo;s easier not to look in different
  places).
- It&rsquo;s a pain to deal with multiple separate gists that are all
  conceptually part of the same project.
- Commits from the gists have been rebased so their commit messages describe
  what they did. This is mostly valuable for the [Wikipedia user
  style](wikipedia.org/), since the CSS itself (rather than the README) went
  through twelve commits.
