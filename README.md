# userstyles - some drafts of user styles

These are some drafts of user styles. They can be used with a user-style
manager such as [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html). They may still have
bugs. As of this writing, I haven&rsquo;t uploaded them to a user styles
repository such as [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/).

By the way, as is usually the case with user styles, I&rsquo;m *not* affiliated
with any of the sites these user styles are for.

## History

Versions of these were originally posted as gists. They are probably still
similar to those gists, but I recommend you use this repository instead,
because:

- Updates/bugfixes, if any, will go here.
- New user styles, if any, are likely to go here.
- It&rsquo;s a pain to deal with multiple separate gists that are all
  conceptually part of the same project.
- Commits from the gists have been rebased so their commit messages describe
  what they did. This is mostly valuable for the [Wikipedia user
  style](wikipedia.org/), since the CSS itself (rather than the README) went
  through twelve commits.
