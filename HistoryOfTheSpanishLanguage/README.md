**rough draft of user style for [http://acme.highpoint.edu/~drauga04/History of the Spanish Language/](http://acme.highpoint.edu/~drauga04/History%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Language/) readability**
(can be applied via Stylus or Stylish)

This user style is for Alexandra Draughan&rsquo;s &ldquo;The History of the
Spanish Language: A Timeline&rdquo; page. As with all user styles in this
repository, this is totally unofficial (so the page author/owner is not
responsible for any problems with it!).
