**rough draft of user style for [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com)
readability** (can be applied via Stylus or Stylish)

This supersedes [that
gist](https://gist.github.com/EliahKagan/b62faab3723a72750af55ec11c58e684).

This was previously a user style for `docs.microsoft.com`, but that was
replaced with `learn.microsoft.com`, which has all the content. This user style
appears to work at least as well as it did before, without modification.
